# Mini API App

I built this app to better understand how API calls work. It fetches fake data from a JSON file and lets you filter recipes by ingredient. You can also click on a dish to see more details in modal window.

## Features

- **Get All Dishes**: Press a button to fetch a list of all dishes.
- **Filter by Ingredient**: Choose an ingredient from a dropdown to find matching recipes then click _GET DISH_.
- **Modal Window**: Click on a dish image to view detailed information in a modal window.

## Prerequisites

This app is made with static files only (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). No external packages or dependencies are required.

## Deployment

You can access the app here: [Mini API App on Netlify](https://mini-api-app.netlify.app/)

## Acknowledgments

This project was a great learning experience as I was starting to dive into programming.
